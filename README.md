ColorBeam
=========
This project is as puzzle/strategy game designed purely for entertainment.

To run the project, download http://www.haydenlakept.com/cs/project/CS360_Final.zip, 
extract the file, and run the executable jar file. Note that this jar file must be maintained
in the same root directory as the other files, as they are essential for the program to function.

All of my personal code can be found under core\src\com\bbaird\colorbeam for review and analysis.
Other folders were created by libGDX for portability from Desktop to Mobile devices.

The final report can be found in the Git wiki.

Requires the most recent version of Java.
